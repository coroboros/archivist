description: Look up which Claude Platform data your key encrypts, what turns off or changes, and what stays under Anthropic's key.

For Claude Enterprise, see [What CMEK covers on Claude Enterprise](./manage-claude-cmek-coverage-claude-enterprise.md). Beta and research preview features that aren't listed here might not be covered by customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK).

## Encrypted with your key

* Message content.
* Files and attachments, whether sent inline with a request or uploaded with the Files API.
* MCP and tool configuration.
* [Claude Managed Agents](../managed-agents/managed-agents-overview.md) (beta) data, including agent configurations, environments, webhooks, sessions and their events, [memory stores](../managed-agents/managed-agents-memory.md) (beta) and their memories and memory versions, and [dreams](../managed-agents/managed-agents-dreams.md) (research preview).
* Batch API and Skills API data stored at rest.
* Tool data stored at rest by web search, web fetch, code execution, bash, text editor, MCP connector (beta), structured outputs, advisor tool (beta), computer use, browser use, and context management.
* Backups and snapshots, which inherit the key.

## Turned off or changed

This list is not exhaustive. Review it with your team before you set up CMEK.

## Encrypted with Anthropic's key

## Where CMEK does not apply: Claude Code telemetry

When Claude Code connects through an LLM gateway or proxy (a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), CMEK does not apply to Claude Code's operational telemetry. To turn this telemetry off, set the `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `1`, as described under [Telemetry services](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/data-usage#telemetry-services) in the Claude Code documentation.
